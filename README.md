# Simple Website Views Farming Bash Script

### Features

- Checks for internet connection
- Checks for needed packages
- Continuously requests website using curl
- Visits website in 1 to 10 parallel processes (for faster execution)
- Suitable for lower-end systems
- By default limited to 1 second delay and max 10 parallel processes
- curl requests are randomized with rotation of User-Agent and other headers
- curl doesn't store session or cookies (filters non-IP rate limiting mechanisms)
- Intended to farm views on websites (like GItHub,...)
- This is not a DDoS program! Don't use it as such!

### Necessary packages

Install them by using appropriate command of your linux distro/flavour<br />
Example: `sudo apt-get install parallel`

- curl
- parallel
- bc

### How-to

### Possible improvements

- implement in-script changing proxy to peroodically change requesting IP address to make vistis more natural and to avoid rate limiting on certain systems
